Just open the file yyAss1.ipynb and click Run all then it can be run.

It has five part:

Part1 and 2 is given.
Part 3 is select the required review type
Part 4 is one time run for check the model runs well and the model has already converged.
Part 5 is 5 times run for ckeck the stable of model and the average accuracy.

*****I think the most important thing is to click 'run all' and wait.*****

part 4 could run 12 seconds, sometimes it could be 20s,I do not know why it could suddenly comes to 20s for just one time.
Part 5 could run 30-53 seconds.

I hope this README file can really help you.
